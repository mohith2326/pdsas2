train data set.
for the first questiion,it states to remove all the null values. so only null values we have is in the column 'New_Price' so now this comes as categorically column.so i had replaced the null value with the mode so the most frequent values are replaced with the null values.
for the second question,i had removed kmpl,cc,bhp,lakhs so that the value will be a numerical value.
for the third question,i changed the fuel_type and transmission variables into a numerical encoded values.
for the final question ,i had created a new column 'car_age' as per question adjusted i had subtraced the 'year' value with the curent year.
